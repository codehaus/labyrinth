      <ul>
    	<li>
    		Unable to load a project which extends another using a URL
    		<br/>
    		The project loader depends on physical files which is no use for 
    		remote projects.
    	</li>
    	<li>
	    	There are going to be ID collisions through genuine confusion / malice / accident.
	    	<br/>
	    	We need to start considering how collisions will be handled by Maven and
	    	what kind of namespace we want to use. For now, make Overlord less
	    	dependent on the ID being a primary key.
