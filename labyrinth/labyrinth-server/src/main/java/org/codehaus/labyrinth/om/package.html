While the object mapping objects implement Serviceable, they are not
managed by the Avalon container.  The components need to be able to
access the container to get hold of their peer objects which allow them 
to save, load and access other parts of the system.

It may turn out that this is better done by using a singleton. I just hate
singletons as they are the bane of my existence when it comes to multiple classloaders
ala virtually any servlet engine.
